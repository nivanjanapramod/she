            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              171 Engineering colleges with an enrolment ratio of girls - 36%
              GCE Kannur catering to the northern malabar region of Kerala - 51% of the annual intake of UG in GCEK are girls!
              The percentage of women drops from 30% to 8% in a span of 10 years after graduation
              Government College of Engineering Kannur has a history of almost thirty years. The college admits 300 students in five branches of study every year and over half of the enrolled are girls and this has remained steady over the years. The majority female students admitted in the past and present have displayed steadfast academic performance and have many a times outnumbered their male counterparts in securing academic laurels such as university ranks. However the unpleasant truth is that a good number of these female academic achievers fail to shine later on in their career and number of alumnae who dwell in the lead roles in jobs are only handful. This dire reality has forced us to put some serious thoughts on the puzzling question “Why So Few?”.

              The future of a country hinges on ensuring that the generations to come are adequately represented, qualified and able to carry the mantle of development forward. Advocating and recognizing women's contributions in technology and the way they collaborate to drive innovation and business growth has to be raised. A leading authority of professional tech savvy women has to be built.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, ‘Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)’ was introduced by the HR cell of GCEK to bridge this existing gap of women in tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape. The program has been planned in segments and the first phase of the SHE program has focused on training and mentoring of 50 selected female students. These fifty students are perceived to act as “Peer Leaders” who will propagate and partake in providing training to the remaining girls of GCEK.

          <h3>Mode of Operation</h3>

              The coordinators of SHE program have well identified the value of our resourceful alumni and have ensured their fruitful participation in gathering suggestions and information. The other promising contributors to the program are the teaching fraternity of GCEK , resource persons from external agencies and experts from different walks of life. The SHE program also seeks all the support from PTA and the HRD Cell of GCEK
